<h1> Quill: An Exercise in NLP </h1>
I created Quill to venture into NLP and Machine Learning.
 With doing my Dual Degree in English and Computer Science, I thought of no better way to take advantage of what I have been able to learn about the concept
 of a language and the literature behind the history of languages than to incorporate NLP into my studies.

 <h2> Quill </h2>
Quill is a poem verse generator that creates poems in the style of various famous literary authors and poets such as Hemingway, Angelou and more. It is developed using 
Python and various NLP based technologies like NLTK, Word2Vec and PyTorch. 

This exercise is for my own enjoyment and to develop my programming skills as well as other skills such as writing _good_ code as opposed to just working code, proper documentation and good habits when it comes to organizing files, managing a repository, etc etc. If anyone runs into this and wants to help, or provide feedback, you are completely welcome to.
