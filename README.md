<h1> Quill: An Exercise in NLP </h1>
I created Quill to venture into NLP and Machine Learning.
 With doing my Dual Degree in English and Computer Science, I thought of no better way to take advtange of what I have been able to learn about the concept
 of a language and the literature behind the history of languages than to incorporate NLP into my studies.

 As a current idea, Quill so far is split into two different programs...
 
 <h2> Quill Ode </h2>
Quill Ode is a poem verse generator that creates poems in the style of various famous literary authors and poets such as Hemingway, Angelou and more. It is (going to be) developed using 
PyTorch, Word2Vec and NLTK amongst other technologies that I see fit through it's lifetime. 

<h2> Quill Tome </h2>
Quill Tome is a lightweight chatbot that aims to be a wealth of knowledge for all things Literature, both old and new. It will also be using PyTorch and NLTK, potentially along with Rasa, Amazon Neptune or TextBlob (I will only plan to support the English language).

This exercise is for my own enjoyment and to develop my programming skills amongst other skills such as writing _good_ code as opposed to just working code, proper documentation and good habits when it comes to organizing files, managing a repository, etc etc.
