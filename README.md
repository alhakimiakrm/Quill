<h1> Quill: An Exercise in NLP </h1>
I created Quill to venture into NLP and Machine Learning.
 With doing my Dual Degree in English and Computer Science, I thought of no better way to take advantage of what I have been able to learn about the concept
 of a language and the literature behind the history of languages than to incorporate NLP into my studies.

I combined hway_aggregate and hway_words into just wordFreq to clean up the code a little bit. From here, I would like to now extract phrases or chunks of text from Hemingway's poems and find not only the structure of his poems, but the structure of a poem. I'd use his current poems that I have as some examples since he has some pretty good baselines.
In the future when I incorporate different artists, I would be able to take advantage of the template I've made for him.

 <p> I might go about this using Word2Vec. I plan on using PyTorch to train my Word2Vec model. The main goal here is to get my program to find the structure of a poem. The meter and rhythm, stanza structures and other stylstic elements that comprise a poem. This link from TensorFlow seems to be a really helpful resource to use for the future.

<h3> As a current idea, Quill so far is split into two different programs... </h3> 
 
 <h2> Quill Ode </h2>
Quill Ode is a poem verse generator that creates poems in the style of various famous literary authors and poets such as Hemingway, Angelou and more. It is (going to be) developed using 
PyTorch, Word2Vec and NLTK amongst other technologies that I see fit through it's lifetime. 

<h2> Quill Tome </h2>
Quill Tome is a lightweight chatbot that aims to be a wealth of knowledge for all things Literature, both old and new. It will also be using PyTorch and NLTK, potentially along with Rasa, Amazon Neptune or TextBlob (I will only plan to support the English language).

 This exercise is for my own enjoyment and to develop my programming skills amongst other skills such as writing _good_ code as opposed to just working code, proper documentation and good habits when it comes to organizing files, managing a repository, etc etc. If anyone runs into this and wants to help, or provide feedback, you are completely welcome to. Do not expect to see good practices in play though, I suck pretty bad right now lol.
