<h1> Quill: An Exercise in NLP </h1>
I created Quill to venture into NLP and Machine Learning.
 With doing my Dual Degree in English and Computer Science, I thought of no better way to take advantage of what I have been able to learn about the concept
 of a language and the literature behind the history of languages than to incorporate NLP into my studies.

I've implemented a few functions to try and find common words, themes and phrases. It's absolutely not fleshed out yet and truthfully, I'm a bit lost on how to more efficiently accomplish those tasks.
I thought that maybe having a general aggregate function that goes over all of Hemingway's poems would be the most effective and least time consuming but I am thinking that it might help to take the extra time
to pinpoint these things for the future of the program.

<p> Thinking ahead, I am trying to see what the best way to go about training a model would be for Quill. I need it to read the data I provide and return the results in order to not only generate a sensible poem, but one that reads the info I provide it with of artists like Hemingway and make it in their style. I saw something about either using a open-source model like GPT or building your own. I don't know that I'd even understand how to build my own, but that is something I'll have to continue researching to make Quill what I want it to be.

<h3> As a current idea, Quill so far is split into two different programs... </h3> 
 
 <h2> Quill Ode </h2>
Quill Ode is a poem verse generator that creates poems in the style of various famous literary authors and poets such as Hemingway, Angelou and more. It is (going to be) developed using 
PyTorch, Word2Vec and NLTK amongst other technologies that I see fit through it's lifetime. 

<h2> Quill Tome </h2>
Quill Tome is a lightweight chatbot that aims to be a wealth of knowledge for all things Literature, both old and new. It will also be using PyTorch and NLTK, potentially along with Rasa, Amazon Neptune or TextBlob (I will only plan to support the English language).

 This exercise is for my own enjoyment and to develop my programming skills amongst other skills such as writing _good_ code as opposed to just working code, proper documentation and good habits when it comes to organizing files, managing a repository, etc etc. If anyone runs into this and wants to help, or provide feedback, you are completely welcome to. Do not expect to see good practices in play though, I suck pretty bad right now lol.
